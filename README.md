## Quick guide 
1. Download saxon9he.jar (or later) to the jar folder

2. Check make.sh to change the saxon jar information if needed

3. Run

It will create two files for each question type template in the "output" directory. Each file is a question bank in a category. 

4. Import the files as new question banks, selecting "Moodle xml format". 

5. Check the questions created in *-CatA and *-CatB
